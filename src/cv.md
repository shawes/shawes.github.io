## Education

`2013-2018`
**Ph.D., Marine Ecology**, *University of Sydney*, Sydney, NSW, Australia.

Completed a PhD at the University of Sydney, Australia. The topic of the thesis is looking at connectivity patterns of
tropical and temperate reef fish along NSW, using advanced biophysical modelling techniques. Part of the thesis is also
looking at the biological mechanisms that influence connectivity patterns. There was also a fieldwork component that
involved undertaking larval fish surveys on the RV Investigator to gather data to parameterise the models.

**Thesis title:** Modelling reef fish connectivity: Investigating the biological mechanisms that influence connectivity
patterns

**PhD Supervisor:** A/Prof. Will Figueira

**Thesis data chapters**  
*Chapter 1*. Making the right choices: understanding the impact of biophysical dispersal modelling on connectivity
patterns  
*Chapter 2.* Size and stage-dependent vertical migration patterns in the larval fish of temperate reef-associated fishes
and the effects of entrainment in cold-core eddies off the coast off New South Wales, Australia  
*Chapter 3.* Comparing the influence of the implementation of different larval behavioural strategies on connectivity
patterns in biophysical dispersal models  
*Chapter 4.* Estimating the larval dispersal of black cod *Epinephelus daemelii* across is distribution along the
eastern coast of Australia and potential implications for its conservation management

## Experience

`2005-2013`
**Senior Developer**, *Department of Employment, Australian Government*, Canberra and Sydney, Australia.
The role has involved the development of both windows applications and websites to facilitate the Australian
Government’s employment policies. The role is primarily .NET development. Senior developers are required to work on all
parts of the development lifecycle, from gathering requirements, design, coding and testing. Managing a small team of
developers is also part of the duties performed, including project management and mentoring of graduates. All
development incorporated using the .NET 4.0 framework, MVC3 and SQL Server 2008 R2.

`2004-2005`
**Junior Developer**, *Health Insurance Commission, Australian Government*, Canberra, ACT, Australia
Undertook both analyst and programmer roles within the department, working on both Public Key Infrastructure and
e-Health Standards. Developed HL7v3 messaging standards in conjunction with the Standards Australia IT 14-4 working
group.
